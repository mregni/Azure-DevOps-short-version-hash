# Short git version hash extractor

This build step will get the short git version hash and put it in a build/release variable ShortVersionHash. You can use the variable in one of your next build/release steps by using $(ShortVersionHash).

## Why

I created this build step because I needed the short hash instead of the build in long hash.
